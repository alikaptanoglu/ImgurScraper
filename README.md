# ImgurScraper
I wanted to download wallpaper dumps

This was created for my PERSONAL use, but I've been asked for a program like this, so I decided to release it publicly.
It doesn't abuse Imgur's system, as the entire system this uses emulates what your browser would be doing when it loads an album; except of saving it as a temporary image, it saves it locally.

However, if Imgur staff wants me to take down this repo, I happily will ^-^
